## Scenario: 
The Waze data team is currently developing a data analytics project aimed at increasing overall growth by preventing monthly user churn on the Waze app. For the purposes of this project, churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app.

The following project is composed of four parts of the PACE Model consisting of Plan, Analyze, Construct and Execute.

# PLAN 
## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to reduce churn and improve user retention. By identifying users who are at risk of churning and offering them personalized incentives, Waze can prevent these users from leaving the platform. This will help Waze to maintain its user base and grow its business.
